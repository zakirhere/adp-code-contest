# ADP code contest

## Getting Started
This is coding practice project for Redbox team. I extended this to use "typescript" and also a platform to figure out debugging which doesn't work in current 'grunt e2e' framework.

```shell
npm install
```

## Execution CLI
`node_modules/.bin/protractor protractor.cuke.js`
